# Cheapest-DIY-Onewheel
This is a quick guide to a fully DIY onewheel that I have designed that I believe is the best compromise between price and performance.

This guide is quite advanced so be sure to read through the entire project before attempting to build your own board.
I will also be refering to Onewheel(tm) as the board throughout the guide.

Onewheels are dangerous especially if they are DIYed so build and ride at your own risk of injury or death!
