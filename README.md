# Cheapest-DIY-Onewheel
This is a quick guide to a fully DIY onewheel that I have designed that I believe is the best compromise between price and performance.
NOTE: if you live in the UK I will be offering a build service for all parts exept the battery.

This guide is quite advanced so be sure to read through the entire project before attempting to build your own board.
and sorry for waffley text of spelling errors i am just trying to explain the basic information
I will also be refering to Onewheel(tm) as the board throughout the guide.

Onewheels are dangerous especially if they are DIYed so build and ride at your own risk of injury or death!


I will be breaking this guide into 3 key sections Electronics, Structure and Software all of these aspects can be treated individually of eachother but are all essential to building a working board.
