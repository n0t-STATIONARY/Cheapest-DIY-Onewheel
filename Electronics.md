Electronics: 
Motor and Controller:
In a board there are 3 primary electical components these being the controller the motor and the battery.
Fortunatly a company called Spintend has made some of this easier by offering a kit designed for Onewheels there are a few to choose from I highly reccomend 
[this kit](https://spintend.com/collections/diy-onewheel-parts-group/products/diy-onewheel-beast-power-pack7)  only consider this if the price is bellow $330 as listed on 
the website.

but for those on a cheaper budget [this kit](https://spintend.com/collections/diy-onewheel-parts-group/products/diy-onewheel-balanced-board-pack2)  may be more suitable only consider this if the price is bellow $280 as listed on the website.

these kits take care of the motor and the controller and are the easiest way to acuire these two components however if they become unavailable the motor i reccomend is the phub-188 these come in a few veritetes the best one would be the [phub-188rk](https://www.peipeiscooter.com/10-inch-10x6-0-6-wide-tyre-strong-power-max-3000w-double-axles-scooter-hub-motor-wheel-phub-188rk.html) I haven't personally tested this motor however the power setting offered does seem more suitable for the   
application when ordering this motor ensure that the max voltage and power are selected. 

the controller I reccomend should always be purchaused from spintend the most important thing is ensuring that the vesc that is selected has a rated voltage around 15 - 20% greater than the planned max battery voltage (eg. if you are using a 75V battery the VESC should be able to handle atleat 90V but to be safe a 100V vesc would be most suitable for this I reccoment using the [UBOX 100V](https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/single-ubox-100v-100a-motor-controller-based-on-vesc) this controller is high enough voltage and also contains an IMU sensor which is essential for the board to work.
Footsensors:
The kits contain foot sensors which will work well enought to get started with the board and can always be replaced later however if you decide to not go with the     
kits I highly reccomend the sensors designed for car seat detection as these are the best bang for you buck sensors that I have personally tested and these are easy   
to find at a low price on amazon. NOTE: I am working on an opensource solution that is much more reliable than this style of foot sensor i will include a link here 
when it becomes available. 

Battery:
this is the most difficult part of the build and there are a few different options. By far the cheapest option is building your own battery which while this seems like   like a daunting task it is much more achieveable than you might expect I would highly reccomend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKg-jIrr_JE) to fully understand the process of making your own battery you are looking to make an 18s pack ideally I would reccomend molicel P28A 18650 cells. for ideal range you require making a 2p pack so in total you should purchause 36 cells to make the two packs. This guide doesnt focus on the battery so feel free to do aditional reasearch into making or purchausing a suitable battery a key part of the battery that is essential there is a BMS this greatly reduces the risk of damage to the cells and fires.

Additional wireing:
To complete this project you require a soldering iron and a few other components such as heat shrink and varius wire thicknesses and connectors such as bullet connectors and xt60 connectors. all of the required pars are available on amazon so there is no need to worry about ordering these components.
